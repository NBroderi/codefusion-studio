# Open and migrate example

The MSDK contains examples for each microcontroller that demonstrate the usage of peripheral APIs and other supported libraries. These examples are provided as reference.

!!!note
    If you are moving a project to System Planner, follow the steps to [migrate a project to System Planner](../workspaces/migrate-project-to-system-planner.md)

## Duplicate the example folder

!!! warning
    We strongly recommend copying the example projects before modifying any files to preserve the original examples.

1. Open **File Explorer**.
2. Navigate to your installation directory: **SDK>MAX>Examples**
3. Copy the **Examples** folder to the desired location.
4. You can now open an example project in a [single folder workspace](#open-in-a-single-folder-workspace) or a [multi folder workspace](#open-in-a-multi-folder-workspace).

## Open in a single folder workspace

1. Launch an instance of VS Code.
2. Click on the **Explorer** icon in the VS Code activity bar.
3. Click **Open Folder**.

    !!! tip
        Alternatively, click **File > Open Folder** from the top menu.

4. Navigate to the location where you saved the example projects.
5. Select the example project to open.
6. If you receive the notification **Do you trust the authors of the files in this workspace?**, click **Yes, I trust the authors** to continue.
7. If your existing project has not been configured as a CodeFusion Studio workspace, wait for the **Configuring** dialog box to complete before proceeding.
8. Confirm the project is ready by expanding the `.vscode` folder and verifying that the `settings.json` file contains the correct project settings.
