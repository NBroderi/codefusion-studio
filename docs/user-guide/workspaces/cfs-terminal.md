# CFS Terminal

CodeFusion Studio (CFS) introduces a new terminal called the CFS Terminal.

The CFS Terminal is the default terminal that opens when interacting with CodeFusion Studio and provides additional paths for CodeFusion Studio without needing any additional user configuration.
The underlying shell depends on your host operating system:

- `cmd` on Windows
- `zsh` on Mac
- `bash` on Linux
