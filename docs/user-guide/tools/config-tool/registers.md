# Registers

The Registers feature displays registers used by the configuration code and their corresponding values. It also highlights registers that are modified due to changes in peripheral or signal configurations. Modified registers are marked with an asterisk (*).

## Search and filter registers

Use the **Search** field to locate registers by name or address. Use the preset filters to view registers with modified or unmodified values.
