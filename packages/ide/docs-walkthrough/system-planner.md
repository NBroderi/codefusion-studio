## System Planner

Use the System Planner to allocate memory, assign peripherals, and configure clocks and pins per core across multi-core SoCs. Once configured, generate the necessary code for your application.

To access the System Planner, open the CFSCONFIG file at the root of your workspace. See the online [User Guide](https://developer.analog.com/docs/codefusion-studio/latest) for more information.
