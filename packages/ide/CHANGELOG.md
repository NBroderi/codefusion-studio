## ‚ú® New Features

- Navigate and configure your system with the new System Planner, with tools to orchestrate development at both the system and core level:
  - Visualize and manage your entire system from the System Planner dashboard showing cores, allocated peripherals, assigned pins, and memory partitions
  - Define and configure memory partitions for each core with the Memory Allocation tool
  - Assign and configure peripheral blocks to specific cores with the Peripheral Allocation tool
  - Benefit from major UX improvements in the Registers and Pin Config pages for faster, more intuitive hardware setup
- Explore Zephyr-based projects with the Device Tree View that provides instant visibility into hardware components and configurations
- Create and manage single or multi-core projects with the Workspace Creation wizard that provides out-of-the-box templates or custom per-core setup options
- Filter actions by project with the Context View in the Activity Bar, reducing complexity in multi-project environments
- Stay current with hardware definitions through the cloud-based Catalog Manager that automatically syncs SoC metadata in the background
- Configure plugins independently from code generation with each plugin now exposing config settings directly in the GUI
- Extend CodeFusion Studio with your own plugins using the modular, API-driven architecture that can be tailored to specific project needs, such as upgrading RTOS versions
- Develop and debug multi-core applications in a unified environment with improved heterogeneous multi-core debugging capabilities
- Access the latest RTOS features with Zephyr plugins now compatible with Zephyr 4.1
