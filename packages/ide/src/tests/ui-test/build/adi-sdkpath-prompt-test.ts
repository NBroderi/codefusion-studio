/**
 * The purpose of this test case is to verify that the user is notified and prompted when the sdk path is missing.
 * The test case functions by opening the helloworld project folder located in the ui-test/data directory, configures the workspace and attempts to run build task.
 * If the sdk path is missing, the user is prompted with a notification to select the sdk path. If the sdk path is present, the user is not prompted. Thus, this is the pass/fail criteria.
 * The pass fail criteria is implemented using the chai assertion "expect".
 * The test case can be run as a standard ui-test via the terminal or Run and Debug (Debug UI Test).
